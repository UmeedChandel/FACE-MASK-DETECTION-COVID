# FACE MASK DETECTION COVID PROJECT
Trained a model to detect mask using datasets to make predictions using:
1. **TensorFlow**: free and open-source software library for machine learning.
1. **Keras**: provides an interface for the TensorFlow library.(also used _MobileNetV2_ as convolutional neural network)
1. **Imutils**: series of convenience functions to make basic image processing functions.
1. **NumPy**: library adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
1. **OpenCV**: a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing.
1. **Matplotlib**: a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
1. **SciPy**: free and open-source Python library used for scientific computing and technical computing.

Used DNN Face Detector and the mask detector model that we trained to test whether a person is wearing a mask or not in real time.
